# Equipment for indoor gardening

To learn more about the Kratky method, see [Resources](../resources/README.md) section.

## Recommended
* log book and pen - take notes; what is working well, what did not work well 
* [measuring bucket](measuring_bucket.jpg)
* big spoon for mixing solution
* teaspoons (one for liquids and another for powder to mix)
* [Kerr wide mouth quart mason jars](kerr_wide_mouth_quart_jars.jpg) from Amazon or Walmart or even your local supermarket. 
* [3" net cups](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B077S4GPKL). A [net cup](net_cup.jpg) is something to hold the medium/plant. It is typically plastic and can be re-used. I have seen videos of people using a soldering iron to cut holes out of cheap, plastic cups.
* Coconut coir: I ordered a [large block from Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOD2HY). Here is the [sheet](coir_big.jpg) that came with it. You just [add water and wait for it to hydrate](coir_absorbing_water.jpg).
* Plant food: I'd recommend [this](https://smile.amazon.com/Fertilizer-Minerals-Greenway-Biotech-Inc/dp/B07DM4WTT1) or [this](https://www.healthrangerstore.com/collections/ultraclean-plant-food/products/lettuce-formula-8-15-36-1-lb). 1 pound of this plant food should grow about 100 pounds of lettuce.
* [CalMag](https://smile.amazon.com/General-Hydroponics-GH1772-CALiMAGic-Quart/dp/B00GZRKI40)
* seeds: non-[GMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism) [heirloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom_plant) are preferred [start with lettuce](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P18ZNNA) or you can pick some up at your local Home Depot, hardware store, supermarket, etc.

## Optional
* [pH meter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JC9BSNRpH) (optional, but is available for under $20)
* [TDS meter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JC9BSNR) (optional, but is available for under $20)
* measuring cup (optional, use as a scoop out of the larger bucket)
* table for mixing/working (optional)
* buckets with lids (optional but very useful to have)
* small cup to hold water to rinse off teaspoons/big mixing spoon
* [temperature/humidity sensor](temp_and_humidity.jpg) (optional)
* racks (optional, I like them with wheels)
* screw driver (to poke hole in reflective material)
* blue painters tape (optional)
* [reflective roll](reflective_roll.jpg) [available at HomeDepot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Reflectix-16-in-x-25-ft-Double-Reflective-Insulation-Roll-with-Staple-Tab-Edge-ST16025/100012574)
* zip ties (optional, to keep reflective material in place)
* snips (optional, to cut zip ties)
* scissors (helpful to open seed packets and cut the reflective material)

## Simple Kratky in standalone containers
This seems to be the easiest way to get started. Just need a few supplies. With less than $100, you should be able to get started. This method is best for leafy vegetables like lettuce. It will not work for things like cucumbers nor tomatoes. For that, you would want a reservoir that feeds a tub so the plant gets plenty of water/nutrients. See the Mini-Farm below.

I also like this method as I can scale-up or scale-down as many jars as I want. For instance, I could plant a few jars each week for 8 to 10 weeks to have a continuous flow of lettuce. Once I have all of my materials, the only real work would be to mix up 3 gallons of solution from time-to-time. The rest should be super simple and quick. [jar with netcup](jar_with_netcup.jpg)

### Painting the jars (optional)
I read that you want to keep the light out of the jar. Some people have used aluminum foil, others have used construction paper. I thought it would be good to paint them. So, I bought some acrylic paint and made a mess. I put a couple of coats on. They looked okay. Trouble began when some water got on the surface where I had the jars. The [paint came right off](do_not_use_acrylic.jpg). Argh. Should have done more research about the paint.

I have since switched to using spray paint (that will work on glass). I started with [black paint](krylon_51601_black_gloss.jpg), but I think [white paint](krylon_51501_white_gloss.jpg) would keep the water cooler, if used on a window sill. So, I'm using white spray paint.

Note: I would not recommend spray painting in high wind conditions. Multiple light coats work best.
When the jars are jostled against each other, the paint does come off, so this is not ideal, but seems to work okay.

### Used plastic containers instead of glass jars (optional)
I have been storing some used plastic containers from things like Costco chocoloate covered raisins, [cashews](cashew_jar.jpeg) etc. I have painted them using black spray paint. I temporarily put some 36" [garden spikes in the ground, then put the container upside down on the spike](plastic_jugs_being_painted.jpg). Two coats seem to work the best.

Other than the container being plastic instead of glass, it is the same as the Kerr mason jars above.

### Adding medium to netcup
I am using Coconut Coir as my medium. [Coir](coir.jpg) is what came with the Mini-Farm (see below). I like it and it seems easy to work with. Plus, it is re-usable. 

### Make up solution
I have been using [lettuce formula](../nutrients/README.md#Lettuce) for most plants.

### Add solution
Pour in the solution into the jar. The bottom third of the netcup should be covered. (If you do not put enough solution, your plant will dry out and die.)

### Plant seeds
Plant seed according to recommendation. Typically 1/4" to 1/8" down. I have recently had lettuce sprout in two days, but can take a few more days.

### Lighting
Put in window sill (or optionally under grow lights). I am only using grow-lights, since I want to grow year-round in a controlled environment. I do not know much about lights, so I just picked up what was [available at Home Depot](led_light_front.jpg) [back](led_light_back.jpg). They were pricy at $134/each, but they are LED, so there should not be too much heat generated. [product info](https://www.feit.com/products/grow-lights/blue-spectrum-dual-2ft-led-plant-grow-light-3/) or [spec sheet](GLP14FS_HB_80W_LED_SpecSheet.pdf) I have my grow lights "on" from from 6am to 10pm. I bought a simple [timer](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVFF59S).

### Racks (optional)
I planned on taking an area of a bedroom in my basement. I wanted to be able to experiment and grow as I wanted. So, I opted to use wire racks with wheels. To maximize the lighting, I used reflective material that I ziptie/tape to the racks. I have grown this from a [single rack](single_rack.jpg) [covered](single_rack2.jpg) [inside](one_rack2.jpg) to [two racks](two_racks.jpg) [alt](two_racks2.jpg) [inside](two_racks_internal.jpg), and currently am on three racks. 

## Kratky using Mini-Farm Grow Box
[This](https://www.healthrangerstore.com/collections/mini-farm-grow-box-2-0/products/food-rising-mini-farm-grow-box-2-0-green-leafy-vegetables-starter-kit-with-4-hole-lid) is what motivated me to get started. It looked simple enough. I thought would buy one, then build others based on what I learned. I bought a mini-farm grow box and some plant food. Turns out that I could buy the food for less via different sources online.

The instructions [front](food_rising_mini_grow_farm_instructions_front.jpg) [back](food_rising_mini_grow_farm_instructions_back.jpg) were fairly easy. It was hard for me to insert the tube into the bucket. It was _very_ tight. The float [front](supply_rising_float_front.jpg) [back](supply_rising_float_back.jpg). [Fully assembled](supply_rising_assembled.jpg)

I was disappointed that the "bonus" CalMag did not ship with my order. But, it got me started doing hydro, so I really should not complain too much.

## Making my own Grow boxes
After I had the Mini-Farm setup, I found the pieces to make my own grow boxes.

The biggest problem so far is that the white tubing leaks from the white buckets. I have tried using some [caulking](bucket_with_caulk.jpg) to minimize this issue. I also had problems cutting the wood to fit inside the containers. I would use a bit better wood next time as this really cheap wood kept chipping when I tried to cut it. I am still tweaking things. I am going to try clay pebbles instead of coir.

I bought some [10 gallon Husky](husky_ten.jpg) containers from Home Depot, bought some [cheap wood](cheap_wood.jpg), cut it down to about 14"x20", then used a jig saw to cut it to fit, drilled some holes for the netpots, and [painted the wood](painted_wood.jpg). I found [float](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076HJZQMY) on Amazon. I assembled the [float](float_and_tee.jpg) and put the [float in the bucket](float_in_bucket.jpg). I now have a few [custom mini farms](custom_mini_farms.jpg).
