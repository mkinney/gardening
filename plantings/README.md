# Plantings

If possible, I look for non-[GMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism) seeds. I also look for [heirloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom_plant), in case I want to not have to buy seeds again. I am lazy and I try to look for [parthenocarpic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocarpy), so I do not have to do the pollination manually. I am currently growing all indoors without any fans. I prefer determinate varieties, due to space limitations. Lighting is from 6am to 10pm.

These are in alphabetical order by vegetable name.

## Beans
Planted some green beans.
<br>[04/03/19](files/IMG_4996.jpg) - first sprout
<br>[04/04/19 left 2](files/IMG_5008.jpg)
<br>[04/05/19 left 2](files/IMG_5023.jpg)
<br>[05/16/19 left 2](files/IMG_5468.jpg) - Looking good; I keep getting dead leaves but there are beans growing

## Broccoli
* 03/06/19 - Planted [Seeds of Change Broccoli](files/seeds_of_change_broccoli_front.jpg) ([back](files/seeds_of_change_broccoli_back.jpg)) in coir, in custom mini farm using [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce). I planted multiple seeds in case some did not sprout.
[03/17/19](files/IMG_4622.jpg)
<br>I ended up transplanting one seedling to another netcup.
<br>[03/22/19 left 2](files/IMG_4658.jpg) and [03/22/19 bottom right](files/IMG_4659.jpg)
<br>[03/23/19 left 2](files/IMG_4665.jpg) and [03/23/19 bottom right](files/IMG_4666.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19 left 2](files/IMG_4689.jpg) and [03/24/19 bottom right](files/IMG_4690.jpg)
<br>[03/25/19 left 2](files/IMG_4702.jpg) and [03/25/19 bottom right](files/IMG_4703.jpg)
<br>[03/27/19 left 2](files/IMG_4755.jpg) and [03/27/19 bottom right](files/IMG_4756.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19 left 2](files/IMG_4985.jpg) and [04/02/19 bottom right](files/IMG_4986.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19 left 2](files/IMG_5002.jpg) and [04/04/19 bottom right](files/IMG_5003.jpg)
<br>[04/05/19 left 2](files/IMG_5017.jpg) and [04/05/19 bottom right](files/IMG_5018.jpg)
<br>Ended up giving up on these. They got big and bushy, but not really worth the effort.

## Carrots
* 03/17/19 - Planted [Botanical Little Finger Carrots](files/botanical_carrots_little_finger_front.jpg) ([back](files/botanical_carrots_little_finger_back.jpg)) using coir medium and plastic [jar](../equipment/files/cashew_jar.jpeg) that was [painted](../equipment/files/plastic_jugs_being_painted.jpg). Here I am [adding the solution to the jugs](../equipment/files/prep_plastic_jugs.jpg). The water goes up to just under the white label. 
<br>[03/17/19 - front 4 jugs](files/IMG_4625.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19 - front 4 jugs](files/IMG_4657.jpg) - Got first sprout
<br>[03/23/19 - front 4 jugs](files/IMG_4663.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19 - front 4 jugs](files/IMG_4681.jpg) - All 4 have sprouts
<br>[03/27/19 - left 3 jugs, and center jug](files/IMG_4753.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19 - left 3 jugs](files/IMG_4999.jpg)
<br>[04/23/19](files/IMG_5238.jpg) - not much of a harvest; hopefully 2nd batch will be better
<br>ended up pulling the plug on the carrots

* TBD
<br>[04/03/19](files/IMG_4997.jpg) - sprouting (left row and back 2)
<br>[04/04/19 - back 4](files/IMG_4999.jpg)
<br>ended up pulling the plug on the carrots

## Cauliflower
* 03/06/19 - Planted [Botanical Early Snowball Cauliflower](files/botanical_cauliflower_early_snowball_front.jpg) ([back](files/botanical_cauliflower_early_snowball_back.jpg)) in coir, in custom mini farm using [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce).
[03/17/19](files/IMG_4622.jpg)
<br>I ended up transplanting some other netcups.
<br>[03/22/19 right 2](files/IMG_4658.jpg) and [03/22/19 all but bottom right](files/IMG_4659.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19 right 2](files/IMG_4689.jpg) and [03/24/19 all but bottom right](files/IMG_4690.jpg)
<br>[03/25/19 right 2](files/IMG_4702.jpg) and [03/25/19 all but bottom right](files/IMG_4703.jpg)
<br>[03/27/19 right 2](files/IMG_4755.jpg) and [03/27/19 all but bottom right](files/IMG_4756.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19 right 2](files/IMG_4985.jpg) and [04/02/19 all but bottom right](files/IMG_4986.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19 right 2](files/IMG_5002.jpg) and [04/04/19 all but bottom right](files/IMG_5003.jpg)
<br>Ended up giving up on these. They were growing, but not really worth the effort.

## Celery
* Early March 2019 - Planted [Seeds of Change Utah Celery](files/seeds_of_change_celery_front.jpg) ([back](files/seeds_of_change_celery_back.jpg)) seeds. They never sprouted. Not sure if medium was not moist enough, if I planted the seeds too deep, or if the seeds were duds.
<br>[03/17/19 right tub](files/IMG_4627.jpg)


## Cilantro
* 03/04/19 - Planted four [Seeds of Change Slow Bolt Cilantro](files/seeds_of_change_cilantro_front.jpg) ([back](files/seeds_of_change_cilantro_back.jpg)) seeds in acrylic painted wide mouth mason jars with [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce). One jar got too dry and even though I saw some [initial sprouts](files/cilantro_lettuce_and_tomato.jpg), they died. The other jar was fairly dry, but I think I caught it in time. Now, I am more generous with the intial amount of solution in the jar. 
<br>[03/17/19 - back left 2 jars](files/IMG_4625.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19 - back row, left - has 3 or 4 starts](files/IMG_4657.jpg)
<br>[03/23/19 - back row, left - has 3 or 4 starts](files/IMG_4663.jpg) - Was dry; added more solution to top
<br>[03/24/19 - back row, left - has 3 or 4 starts](files/IMG_4681.jpg)
<br>[03/25/19 - back row, left](files/IMG_4700.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19 - big growth on left](files/IMG_5001.jpg)

* 03/28/19 - Planted 2 more in jars
<br>[04/04/19 - front left 2 jars](files/IMG_4999.jpg)

## Cucumbers
* 03/29/19 - Planted some [Reimer Diva Cucumbers](files/reimer_diva_cucumbers.jpg). They are parthenocarpic. I now have a 6' growing shelf, so I'm looking forward to planting cukes.
<br>[04/04/19 - right 4](files/IMG_5008.jpg)
<br>[05/16/19 - right 3](files/IMG_5468.jpg) - They are overshadowed by the beans, but growing well
<br>[05/20/19 - right 3](files/IMG_5512.jpg) - I see two flowers. Yay!

## Dill
* 03/28/19 - Planted two [Seeds of Change Dill](files/seeds_of_change_dill_front.jpg) ([back](files/seeds_of_change_dill_back.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19 - middle row - 2 jars](files/IMG_4999.jpg)

## Lettuce

* 03/03/19 - Planted a single [Ohio Buttercrunch Lettuce](files/ohio_lettuce_buttercrunch.jpg) seed in acrylic painted wide mouth mason jars using coconut coir media using [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce). They sprouted quickly, but they did not make it. I put the water at the bottom of the netcup, but I think I either did not put enough water in the jar or it dried out. Also, do not use acrylic paint on glass. When it gets wet, the paint comes off and gets everywhere. Here is my very first [bud](files/first_bud.jpg) on 03/06, only 3 days after planting.

* 03/10/19 - Planted three [Ohio Buttercrunch Lettuce](files/ohio_lettuce_buttercrunch.jpg) seeds in mason jars.
<br>[03/17/19 back right 3 jars](files/IMG_4625.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19 back right 3 jars](files/IMG_4657.jpg)
<br>[03/23/19 back right 3 jars](files/IMG_4663.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19 back right 3 jars](files/IMG_4681.jpg)
<br>[03/25/19 back right 3 jars](files/IMG_4700.jpg) - Starting to look really good.
<br>[03/27/19 front middle jars](files/IMG_4754.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19 middle](files/IMG_4984.jpg) - Was out of town for a few days. One of them started to look pretty [wilty](files/IMG_4993.jpg). Turns out, there was no water in the jar any more. I added more lettuce solution about half way in jar. The other two jars had less than one inch of water, but were doing fine.
<br>[04/04/19](files/IMG_5001.jpg) and [04/04/19 one may not recover](files/IMG_5004.jpg)

* 03/17/19 - Planted 4 [Ohio Buttercrunch Lettuce](files/ohio_lettuce_buttercrunch.jpg) seeds in jugs.
<br>[03/22/19 - middle 4 jugs](files/IMG_4657.jpg)
<br>[03/23/19 - middle 4 jugs](files/IMG_4663.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19 - middle 4 jugs](files/IMG_4681.jpg)
<br>[03/25/19 - middle 4 jugs](files/IMG_4700.jpg) - one never sprouted so I dumped it.
<br>[03/27/19 - middle front, middle back, right back](files/IMG_4753.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19 - back, middle 2](files/IMG_4999.jpg)

* 03/23/19 - Planted [6](files/IMG_4676.jpg) more [Ohio Buttercrunch Lettuce](files/ohio_lettuce_buttercrunch.jpg) seeds in 6 white painted mason jars. I'm trying a different medium setup. [Bottom two thirds of netcup will be clay pebbles](files/IMG_4672.jpg), [top third is coir](files/IMG_4673.jpg), [water mostly to rim of jar](files/IMG_4674.jpg) with [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce).
<br>[03/27/19 - right 6 white jars](files/IMG_4754.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19 back 6 jars](files/IMG_4984.jpg)
<br>[04/03/19](files/IMG_4998.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19](files/IMG_5001.jpg)

## Onions

* ? - Planted [Botanical Walla Wall Onions](files/botanical_walla_walla_onion_front.jpg) ([back](files/botanical_walla_walla_onion_back.jpg)) - one did not make any sprouts and was too dry. Dumped the small white bucket.

* 03/17/19 - Planted Onions in 2 new buckets - trying with more [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce) 
<br>[03/17/19 all onions - left 2 are from 2nd planting; right 2 are 1st planting](files/IMG_4626.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19 all onions - left 2 are from 2nd planting; right 2 are 1st planting](files/IMG_4682.jpg) - Back left has a sprout
<br>[03/27/19 left 2 are from 2nd planting; back is from 1st planting](files/IMG_4754.jpg)
<br>[05/20/19](files/IMG_5513.jpg)

* 03/29/19 - Planted [Reimer Yellow Granex Onions](files/reimer_yellow_granex_onions.jpg) in [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#lettuce)
<br>[04/04/19 right 4 big jugs](files/IMG_5001.jpg)

## Peppers
* 03/06/19 Planted 4 different kinds of [peppers](files/peppers.jpg) in custom mini farm with [peppers solution](../nutrients/README.md#peppers) in coir medium:
<br>[Burpee Hot Salsa Blend](files/burpee_hot_salsa_blend_front.jpg) ([back](files/burpee_hot_salsa_blend_back.jpg))
<br>[Botanical Early Jalapeno](files/botanical_early_jalapeno_front.jpg) ([back](files/botanical_early_jalapeno_back.jpg))
<br>[Burpee Habanero Blend](files/burpee_habanero_blend_front.jpg) ([back](files/burpee_habanero_blend_back.jpg))
<br>[Burpee Italian Pepperoncini](files/burpee_italian_pepperoncini_front.jpg) ([back](files/burpee_italian_pepperoncini_back.jpg))

<br>[03/17/19](files/IMG_4619.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19](files/IMG_4655.jpg)
<br>[03/23/19](files/IMG_4668.jpg) Concerned about the peppers as it looks like quite a bit of the [coir dropped out into thru the netcup](../equipment/files/IMG_4669.jpg).
<br>[03/24/19](files/IMG_4684.jpg) back left and front left both had half bottom coir dropped out, so I [transplanted them into 100% clay pebbles](files/IMG_4685.jpg)
<br>[03/25/19](files/IMG_4698.jpg)
<br>[03/27/19](files/IMG_4757.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19](files/IMG_4988.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19](files/IMG_5005.jpg)
<br>[05/16/19](files/IMG_5465.jpg) - Several pepperoncinis are growing, sprouts from two other peppers
<br>[05/20/19](files/IMG_5504.jpg) [05/20/19](files/IMG_5507.jpg)

## Radishes
* 03/29/19 - Planted 6 [Reimer Cherriette Radishes](files/reimer_cherriette_radishes.jpg)
<br>[04/03/19](files/IMG_4997.jpg) - sprouting (front 6)
<br>[04/04/19](files/IMG_4997.jpg)
<br>[04/23/19](files/IMG_5236.jpg) - not a big harvest, but very happy about these

* 04/23/19 - Planted 4 more
<br>[05/20/19](files/IMG_5514.jpg)

## Strawberry
* 03/29/19 - Planted [Reimer Italian Alpine Strawberry](files/reimer_italian_alpine_strawberries.jpg) using [strawberry solution](../nutrients/README.md#strawberry).
<br>They never srpouted. Bummer.


## Tomato
* 03/01/19 - Planted four netcups of [RDR Seeds Tiny Toms](files/rdr_tiny_tom_front.jpg) ([back](files/rdr_tiny_tom_back.jpg)) in the [Mini Grow Farm](../nutrients/files/mini_grow_farm_with_tomatoes.jpg) They need to be pollinated so I bought a cheap electric toothbrush. Hopefully, they will last long enough for me to get to that stage. I chose this variety so I did not have to worry about the bushes getting too tall for my grow shelf. [Peppers and Tomatoes in mini-farm](files/tomatoes_and_peppers.jpg).
<br>One netcup did not sprout and another netcup had two starts, so I transplanted one start from the top left to the the bottom right netcup.
<br>[03/22/19](files/IMG_4656.jpg)
<br>[03/23/19](files/IMG_4667.jpg) [good roots](files/IMG_4670.jpg)
<br>[03/24/19](files/IMG_4683.jpg) - Added temp and humidity inside grow area
<br>[03/25/19](files/IMG_4699.jpg) - Right front does not have any white roots to water yet. Manually watered.
<br>[03/27/19](files/IMG_4758.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19](files/IMG_4989.jpg)
<br>[04/03/19](files/IMG_4994.jpg) - Got first flower
<br>[04/04/19](files/IMG_5006.jpg)
<br>[04/23/19](files/IMG_5231.jpg) - Looking good
<br>[05/13/19](files/IMG_5449.jpg) - Picked some tomatoes
<br>[05/16/19](files/IMG_5466.jpg) - Quite a few more tomatoes are growing

* 03/24/19 - Planted six [Reimer](http://www.reimerseeds.com/) [Legend Tomato](files/reimer_legend_tomato.jpg) seeds (well, 2 seeds per netcup). I now have a larger 6' shelf and I want to see if I can avoid doing manual pollination.
<br>[03/24/19](files/IMG_4691.jpg)
<br>[04/02/19](files/IMG_4990.jpg)
<br>[04/04/19](files/IMG_5007.jpg)
<br>[05/16/19](files/IMG_5467.jpg) - Looks like some tomatoes survived a water shortage
<br>[05/20/19](files/IMG_5511.jpg) - One has a big flower
