# Plantings

If possible, I look for non-[GMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism) seeds. I also look for [heirloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom_plant), in case I want to not have to buy seeds again. I am lazy and I try to look for [parthenocarpic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocarpy), so I do not have to do the pollination manually. I am currently growing all indoors without any fans. I prefer determinate varieties, due to space limitations. Lighting is from 6am to 10pm.

These are in alphabetical order by vegetable name.

## Broccoli
* 03/06/19 - Planted [Seeds of Change Broccoli](seeds_of_change_broccoli_front.jpg) ([back](seeds_of_change_broccoli_back.jpg)) in coir, in custom mini farm using [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#Lettuce). I planted multiple seeds in case some did not sprout.
[03/17/19](IMG_4622.jpg)
<br>I ended up transplanting one seedling to another netcup.

## Carrots
* 03/17/19 - Planted [Botanical Little Finger Carrots](botanical_carrots_little_finger_front.jpg) ([back](botanical_carrots_little_finger_back.jpg)) using coir medium and plastic [jar](../equipment/cashew_jar.jpg) that was [painted](../equipment/plastic_jugs_being_painted.jpg). Here I am [adding the solution to the jugs](../equipment/prep_plastic_jugs.jpg). The water goes up to just under the white label.

<br>Got first sprout on 3/22.[03/22/19 - front 4 jugs](IMG_4657.jpg)

## Cauliflower
* 03/06/19 - Planted [Botanical Early Snowball Cauliflower](botanical_cauliflower_early_snowball_front.jpg) ([back](botanical_cauliflower_early_snowball_back.jpg)) in coir, in custom mini farm using [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#Lettuce).
[03/17/19](IMG_4622.jpg)
<br>I ended up transplanting some other netcups.

## Celery
* Early March 2019 - Planted [Seeds of Change Utah Celery](seeds_of_change_celery_front.jpg) ([back](seeds_of_change_celery_back.jpg)) seeds. They never sprouted. Not sure if medium was not moist enough, if I planted the seeds too deep, or if the seeds were duds.

## Cilantro
* 03/04/19 - Planted four [Seeds of Change Slow Bolt Cilantro](seeds_of_change_cilantro_front.jpg) ([back](seeds_of_change_cilantro_back.jpg)) seeds in acrylic painted wide mouth mason jars with [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#Lettuce). One jar got too dry and even though I saw some [initial sprouts](cilantro_lettuce_and_tomato.jpg), they died. The other jar was fairly dry, but I think I caught it in time. Now, I am more generous with the intial amount of solution in the jar. 
<br>[03/17/19 - back left 2 jars](IMG_4625.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19 - back row, left - has 3 or 4 starts](IMG_4657.jpg)

## Cucumbers
* TBD - Ordered some Diva seeds from RDR as they are parthenocarpic. I now have a 6' growing shelf, so I'm looking forward to planting cukes.

## Lettuce
* 03/03/19 - Planted a single [Ohio Buttercrunch Lettuce](ohio_lettuce_buttercrunch.jpg) seed in acrylic painted wide mouth mason jars using coconut coir media using [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#Lettuce). They sprouted quickly, but they did not make it. I put the water at the bottom of the netcup, but I think I either did not put enough water in the jar or it dried out. Also, do not use acrylic paint on glass. When it gets wet, the paint comes off and gets everywhere. Here is my very first [bud](first_bud.jpg) on 03/06, only 3 days after planting.
<br>[03/17/19 - 3 in back right](IMG_4625.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19 - middle 4 jugs, back right 3 jars](IMG_4657.jpg)

## Onions
* ? - Planted [Botanical Walla Wall Onions](botanical_walla_walla_onion_front.jpg) ([back](botanical_walla_walla_onion_back.jpg)) - one did not make any sprouts and was too dry.
* 03/17/19 - Planted Onions in 2 new buckets - trying with more [lettuce solution](../nutrients/README.md#Lettuce) 
<br>[03/17/19 all onions - left 2 are from 2nd planting; right 2 are 1st planting](IMG_4626.jpg)

## Peppers
* 03/06/19 Planted 4 different kinds of [peppers](peppers.jpg) in custom mini farm with [peppers solution](../nutrients/README.md#Peppers) in coir medium.
<br>[03/17/19](IMG_4619.jpg)
<br>[03/22/19](IMG_4655.jpg)


## Tomato
* 03/01/19 - Planted four netcups of [RDR Seeds Tiny Toms](rdr_tiny_tom_front.jpg) ([back](rdr_tiny_tom_back.jpg)) in the [Mini Grow Farm](mini_grow_farm_with_tomatoes.jpg) They need to be pollinated so I bought a cheap electric toothbrush. Hopefully, they will last long enough for me to get to that stage. I chose this variety so I did not have to worry about the bushes getting too tall for my grow shelf. [Peppers and Tomatoes in mini-farm](tomatoes_and_peppers.jpg).
<br>One netcup did not sprout and another netcup had two starts, so I transplanted one start from the top left to the the bottom right netcup.

* TBD - I have ordered some Legend Tomato seeds from RDR. I now have a larger 6' shelf and I want to see if I do not have to do pollination.
