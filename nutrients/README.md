# Nutrients

There is quite a bit to learn about plant nutrients. I am still learning. It may be a life-long journey.

I was intrigued when I first learned about adding a few teaspoons of plant food with some CalMag (calcium magnesium), water and some seeds.


## Lettuce

From what have researched, lettuce likes 8-15-36 and a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5

I started [mixing lettuce solution](mixing_lettuce.jpg). First added 12 quarts (3 gallons) of water. Then I added 4 teaspoons of [Rising Food Lettuce Mix](rising_food_lettuce_formula.jpg). Then added 4 teaspoons of [CALiMAGic](calimagic1.jpg) [CALiMAGic Info](calimagic2.jpg) [CALiMAGic Info2](calimagic3.jpg). I then tested the total desolved solids (TDS) using a [TDS meter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JC9BSNR). After mixing the solution, I measured the pH. I had to add some baking soda to change the pH.

I poured some solution to a [wide mouth mason jar](../equipment/kerr_wide_mouth_quart_jars.jpg) with a 3" [net cup](../equipment/net_cup.jpg). Then, I packed the netcup with [coir](../equipment/coir_absorbing_water.jpg). I planted the [lettuce seeds](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P18ZNNA) about 1/4" down. (In hindsight, I should have only planted the seed about 1/8" down.)

I tried 3 jars of lettuce at first. They all died because I did not put enough water in the jar. I only noticed this after I saw the visible difference of ["wet" media vs. "dry" media](wet_vs_dry_in_jars.jpg). Subsequent plantings have more water and I check that I see [white roots](roots_in_jar.jpg) and the coir medium does not look "orange".

The second planting of lettuce went well. I planted them about 1/8" down and I got sprouts on the 2nd day. I was amazed!

## Peppers

From what have researched, peppers like 11-11-40 and a pH range of 6.0 to 6.5

I started using [pepper mix](rising_food_pepper_formula.jpg).


## Tomato
From what have researched, tomatoes like 4-18-38 and a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5

I mixed the solution similar to the Lettuce formula above.

I started in the [Mini Grow Farm](mini_grow_farm_with_tomatoes.jpg).
