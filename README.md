# Gardening

This repo documents my gardening journey.

Ever since I heard about aquaponics, I wanted to try it. But, I do not know what I do not know, so I am going to keep researching aquaponics. My biggest concerns are how much daily effort will it be, what kind of fish to raise, and where I would put an aquaponics system.

So, I am starting with hydroponics, using the Kratky method.
